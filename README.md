For sending a request with screenshot to the o1 api

Maybe this code helps someone who is searching for "OpenAI api o1" or "send screenshot to OpenAI api o1 model"
I've been searching for a long time and couldnt really find anything useful. (only found o1-preview and stuff and nothing did work for me ...)

The code should also work for the gpt-4o api since it is also one of the few models that support vision:
